TODO LIST:

<!-- General -->

- Looking at new potential technologies that I could integrate with the site such as Grunt, Less and Sass. Grunt to automate a lot of cleanup for me and Less and Sass to try these new CSS pre-compilers to write better CSS.
- Update Grunt to add additional built tasks.
- Study LESS and Sass and see if I could integrate that with the existing project.
- Define a way to showcase small projects. Preferably, a page which lists all of the current project in place, the date in which it was started and the current project status.
- Update the favicon.

<!-- Jekyll Blog -->

- Implement the Jekyll blog.

<!-- Bubble Graph -->

- Integrate the graph.html with a RESTful API so that the content is much more immersive. Specifically job related (i.e. skills in each job posting)
- Find an appropriate API to use.
- Update Javascript so that we can dynamically append each bubbles straight into the container as opposed to defining them manually.
- Update Javascript to modify the size of the bubbles depending on the data received (i.e. Most popular skills will be bigger bubbles)
- Fix: jQuery animation flicker.

<!-- Timeline -->

- Spec out how the timeline can be extended.
- Update the current timeline so that it allows for multiple branching (three branches like a different highway). Similar to the GitFlow cheatsheet so that the timeline is much more accurate. I volunteered for TEDxSalford during university for example not after it.
