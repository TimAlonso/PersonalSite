TODO LIST:

<!-- General -->

- Define a way to showcase small projects. Preferably, a page which lists all of the current project in place, the date in which it was started and the current project status.
- Update the favicon.

<!-- Jekyll Blog -->

- Implement the Jekyll blog.
- Update the style of the blog to use site default style (using SASS)
- Update Grunt to minify CSS and Scripts.

<!-- Bubble Graph -->

- Integrate the graph.html with a RESTful API so that the content is much more immersive. Use Trendy Skills API.
- Update Javascript so that we can dynamically append each bubbles straight into the container as opposed to defining them manually.
- Update Javascript to modify the size of the bubbles depending on the data received (i.e. Most popular skills will be bigger bubbles)

<!-- Timeline -->

- Update the current timeline so that it allows for multiple branching (three branches like a different highway). Similar to the GitFlow cheatsheet so that the timeline is much more accurate. I volunteered for TEDxSalford during university for example not after it.
