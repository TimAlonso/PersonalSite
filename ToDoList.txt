ToDo List

- Looking at new potential technologies that I could integrate with the site but I want to keep it simple for now.
- Design icons to use and replace the current icons.
- Change the CSS of the timeline so that we can quickly distinguish between work, education and projects.
- Change the CSS of the timeline so that we can use bullet points.
- Implement the blog using Jekyll.
- Update the images used in the timeline.
- Spec out how the timeline can be extended.

- Integrate the graph.html with a RESTful API so that the content is much more immersive. Specifically job related (i.e. skills in each job posting)
- Find an appropriate API to use.

- Implement the Jekyll blog.
- Update Grunt to add additional built tasks.
- Study LESS and Sass and see if I could integrate that with the existing project.

- Define a way to showcase small projects. Preferably, a page which lists all of the current project in place, the date in which it was started and the current project status.
