ToDo List

- Add a profile picture in the About section
- Design the site so that the about section will be a long timeline that describe what I've done so far in web development. It will essentially be a LinkedIn profile but interactive (sort of).
- Planning to remove the contact form and adding that into it's own separate page.
- Looking at new potential technologies that I could integrate with the site but I want to keep it simple for now.
- Design icons to use and replace the current icons.
- Replace the images used in the site, it looks too dull at the moment.
